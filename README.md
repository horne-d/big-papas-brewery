# Big Papas Brewery

This was my first project for Code Institute. This was a website designed and built for a new local brewery, to give the user information on what the brewery sells, and an insite into the new state of the art facilities.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript

## UX/UI

I wanted to catch the users eye as soon as they visited the site. With this in mind, I chose a full screen landing page with navigation, with a button to the explore the rest of the site.

You can then get a brief overview of the company and further buttons for navigation, with a "Why Us?" section which details why the company stands out above the rest.

## Pages

### Home
  * You a met with a full screen landing page to catch the users eye, with the button 'explore' so you can navigate further. When clicked, you find a quick intro along with a why us section.

### About Us
  * This page details the companies history, followed by a video tour of the brewery. Then a paragraph to inform the user what the brewery is currently doing in terms of production and ordering.
  
### Products
  * This page lists out the range of products the company makes. I chose to keep this simple, and list the product names in a Bootstrap accordian. Upon opening each, you get a brief description of the product, along with ingredients included to produce.
  
### Order
  * This page allows the user to order. They get a visual representation of the product along with the price. There is also a rating system from the user so you can see how others rated each of the items.
  
### Contact
  * This gives you details on how to contact the company, along with a form which you can complete and send in to get a reply.

# Testing & Bugs

### Testing

I tested this site on multiple devices of different sizes to ensure it was fully responsive. I built the page firstly to function on a computer or laptop, and then allowed this to respond to screen sizes so it works on a phone or tablet.

### Bugs

One of the bigges issues I faced was to make the site responsive on different devices. The main navigation proved most difficult, so I chose to choose Bootstrap navigation which made this easier to ensure navigation worked and looked great on any device.

# Deployment

The final version of the project was deployed to Github.com using its free hosting feature “GitHub Pages” and can be viewed live [here](https://horne-d.github.io/big-papas-brewery/index.html).
