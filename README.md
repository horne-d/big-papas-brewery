# Big Papas Brewery

I was tasked to a 4-5 page website, which included a specific set of requirements.

1. Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas
2. Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this)
3. Include at least one form with validation. Since you are not expected to build a backend for the project, all this form needs to do is inform the user of whether or not the data was submitted successfully (i.e. passed validation)
4. Use semantic HTML5 markup.
5. Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the site on different screen sizes and browsers.
6. The site should contain your own custom JavaScript logic â€“ include at least one interactive component on your site that is based on non-trivial javascript logic. You can write this logic either inside an Angular controller/service, or in a separate js file.
